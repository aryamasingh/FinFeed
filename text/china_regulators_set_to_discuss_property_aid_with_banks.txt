 We've already seen property stocks rising in anticipation of this, but what do we know exactly about the meeting? Yeah, it is a huge meeting. I think the breadth of invitees at this meeting really showcase how important it is. We're looking at senior officials from the housing ministry, from state banks, local governments. They're all attending via video conference to discuss this proposal, to potentially buy back millions of homes across the country with the help of state-owned enterprises using loans from state banks. Now, of course, a lot of the details are yet to be sketched out. We'll be watching for that. The big question is how big of a scale is this going to be and how are they going to finance this? Because if you recall in early 2023, the government did roll out something similar on a smaller scale. They had extended about 100 billion yuan of credit through a specialized lending facility. The plan then was to get eight cities on a trial basis to buy back excess housing. But as of March, only two billion yuan had been extended through that program, which shows the reluctance of banks and local governments to get on board. And banks, their balance sheets have been squeezed by non-performing loans and the fact that they're being asked to extend credit cheaply to developers. So these are all questions we don't have answers to. The state council is going to hold that press briefing later this afternoon. Those PBOC is going to be attending along with relevant ministries. So we'll be watching out for details from that press briefing.
