source income leverage explains well generally think income first order driver spending balance sheets second order see issues clear credit card delinquencies according public data new york fed delinquencies highest fastest rising amongst lower income households theyre households also likely maxed cards right way think long labor market holds group fine aggregate course theres going

inflation know spot rents past several months bls take raw data turn crank machine create official statistics really point strongly continuing fall time things going consumer goods theres net average deflation consumer goods think continue rest year real mixed bag services outside housing take one example strange example would talking like auto insurance sky high super strong development product years higher higher costs couple years ago insurance companies finally allowed regulators catch time thats starting fade spent lot time talking colleagues equity research cover insurance companies think thats one examples still friction covid finally working way system mohamed would respond everything seth said think seth good point thing would ask seth may history surprised something else focus higher expected something else comes along earlier morning heard commodity prices heard rallying commodity prices broadening ppi surprise us upside worried good sector thats going surprise us opposed services housing next think thats think thats great concern say especially talking policymakers fed folks washington theyre worried start get worried think worried everything got make forecast got sort idea probabilities lies think good sector us imports lot goods china world imports lot goods china gdp deflator terms theyve deep protracted deflationary episode talking got theyre trying ramp production theyre exporting lot excess capacity rest world think odds much favor disinflationary process goods continuing ok rightly said youve got make projection youre dealing fed thats data dependent heard hear projection need get comfortable yet said talk little bit meld view fed reactive function fed reaction functions thats reactive mean interest rates absolutely know heard j powell say last press conference ive heard say times reiterated bit phil jefferson essentially unparaphrasing want cut interest rates inflation data allow data inflation show theyre downward trajectory inflation ever since beginning hiking cycle theyve said theyre willing cut rates inflation gets back target need see trend perspective sort sell side analyst question would forecast theyre going based forecast inflation going got cpi ppi import prices week clearly said first quarters reflationary data anomaly trend back track think one two months go anything like forecast continued inflation theyre going take signal cut point set data incredibly bumpy say one month something strong next month happens trend instead volatility around data like weve continued see fed think thats challenge trend fact inflation hanging think keep postponing anticipated rate cut eventually theyll maybe change tune think one time chair powell willing swim question reporter press conference know could hike think heard need inflation sort stay roughly need inflation start clearly rising probabilistically speaking think thats likely outcome thats pretty confident let push little bit january got negative surprise inclination consensus misses bump nothing needed two data points confirm something going get one favorable number bump suddenly going back really want going happen asymmetrical danny says noisy data completely agree data noisy im convinced quite asymmetrical weve seen big swings markets right go back january february time frame market pricing six seven cuts got point pricing substantially fewer two cuts things gently coming back direction though swung way back market pricing seven cuts think little bit overreaction definitely subscribe view markets weve forecasting little bit consistent came year thinking thered four cuts total q one said boy thats probably going happen quickly thought weve paired back three year whole havent swinging way market think try least see noise mean hard get keep head around set yoyoing market narratives back forth lisa talks time part confusion trying understand consumer think weve maybe five different takes past three hours consumer credit card data strong delinquencies troubling see spending times mcdonald says consumers arent spending much make sense stuff tricky situation one points try make clients time everything sort build standard narratives around based previous cycles boy take big grain salt salt right vat vinegar youre making choice back story quite tricky lets look data gdp first quarter know consumer spending fine solid two half ish percent consumer spending durable goods negative quarter quarter consumer spending non durable goods flat quarter quarter services sector comes delinquencies lower end income distribution thats really hard time federal transfers wealth people able pay credit cards people wanted go back spending habits prices much higher people trying sort prices actually going could afford lower end income distribution tends get hurt happens thats youre seeing delinquency rates rising mean doom gloom dont think consumer spending 70 percent consumer spending services 70 percent consumption consumption turn 70 percent gdp thats half economy right long thats holding think well pretty decent shape also shouldnt forget reason fed interest rates five five hundred something basis points higher started cycle precisely exert restraint economy spending slowing theyre looking think consumer think massive imports china mentioned earlier even start grapple 2025 could look like get 10 percent tariff ring around united states 60 percent tariff imports china yeah mean think different scenarios might based election tricky theyre manifold think one points easy reduce things biden versus trump think investors also well well reminded also need think composition congress youre thinking fiscal packages tax cuts extra spending thats going require congress tariffs though agree goes day one exactly think think tricky need start modeling things try go back say happened round tariffs last time think theres common view going inflationary full stop think thats worth pressure testing little bit tariffs imposed couple things happened remin b fell dollar currencies fell dollar us imports china actually initially fell since recovered goal maybe didnt get first instance saw fall remember measuring inflation cpi thats final goods tariffs intermediate goods margins compress saw maybe little reaction inflation didnt last defy anyone look chart core goods cpi period distinguish happened 2018 happened years sound like robert lighthizer also catherine tykes week said largely debunked relationship terms tariffs prices put pushback pretty strongly sound like think think think whats really important increases costs costs along way us manufacturing sector took massive hit global trading sector took massive hit fed point somewhat reminiscent hiking path got derailed wasnt morgan stanley time writing disruptive destructive tariff war us economy especially manufacturing sector sure enough fed went thinking sort path continued hiking qt autopilot use chair powells words yeah quickly things changed saw reverberations economy tariffs lets finish friend rick reader blackrock making headlines morning speaking david weston going wear upcoming episode wall street week little bit later evening heres quote want thoughts im certain raising interest rates actually brings inflation might agree point one given rate sensitive certain parts economy might goes though fact would lay argument actually cut interest rates bring inflation want go first would say back totally agree point one point two think hes thinking housing particular high interest rates done supply side
