 People are worried about the immigrants coming in illegally, but how many illegal immigrants do you think we have in the country now? And once somebody is in the country illegally, what percentage actually ever gets sent out? So we have thus far this fiscal year removed or returned more individuals than any administration, I think for at least 10 years. So we're removing and returning more people than any administration, including the immediately proceeding administration. When we took office, I believe the accounting was approximately 11.4 million undocumented people in the United States. We don't have an update to that number now, but it's been millions and millions because our system has been broken for decades.
