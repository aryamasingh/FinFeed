 They have a capital program they need to execute on. Deliveries might not be the trajectory they planned for or hoped for this year, but there's a lot of money that's been invested in expanding the Supercharger network. And, you know, they're basically going to be giving a big gift away to industry unless they execute on supporting customers like Wawa, etc., with their build-out plans. They have the capability. They've spent the money. They need to have the staff there to support the completion of these projects. The headwinds for Tesla haven't really been discussed a whole lot in the charging side. Mr. Musk has made some political mistakes in the way he's been out there fairly aggressive with rhetoric and it's come back to bite him on the capital access side or the support side for the growth of his EB charging network. I'm sure that's driving his frustration with the business, but Tesla's a great company. They have the best network out there. It's going to stay the best if they don't invest any more dollars right now for a while, but it makes economic sense for them to bring people back.
