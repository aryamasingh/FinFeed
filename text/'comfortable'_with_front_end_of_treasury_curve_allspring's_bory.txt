 Do we hold the line at 4.8% here? What's the risk here that rates don't move materially higher on the short end? Given the tremendous bid we have seen at the short end of the curve in the bond market. Yeah, no, I think that also is a very good point. I think you're talking about the two-year part of the curve. If I'm, yes. So I think that there's a good case to be made that you've got good sort of carry that the Fed is stuck at least, at the very least, and on hold for an extended period of time. So the two-year, not a terrible spot to be. And that on balance, the bias would be to cut rates rather than hike rates. So from that perspective, there is some argument to be made that there's some value there. I think 4.8 is very much right in the middle of the range. We are certainly happy to kind of put money to work right in and around the two-year. Certainly if we were gonna add some credit risk in portfolios that adds a little bit of extra yield to the portfolio. So that's not a bad spot. We would feel pretty comfortable in and around that two-year point on the curve. Where else on the curve? Ed, are you looking further out at this point, given you've seen such an investor move into those long ends, and they do have more uncertainties and other factors that would influence the price moves there? Yeah, I mean, I think I would agree with the other speaker. The front end of the curve is still pretty attractive. And we're trying to build confidence to extend our duration out. The fact that the Fed's reaction function, the Fed's strategy at the moment is re-biased towards easing the fact that we're starting to see, again, churn in the labor market starts to come down. The labor market on the margin is showing us some flags of weakness. These are all really great precursors to moving duration further out on the curve.
