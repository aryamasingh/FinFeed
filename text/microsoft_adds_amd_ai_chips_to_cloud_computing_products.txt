 Microsoft announcing it will begin offering its cloud computing customers AMD's AI chips move which will give users an alternative to Nvidia's processors. Microsoft is expected to announce more details at its Build Developer Conference next week. You're taking a look at shares of both companies here moving higher pre-market but AMD the outsize move there it's up by about three and a half percent on this news. I did a lot of learning about actually what it takes for these artificial intelligence chips and the broader data center and what's taking place. Well it's a cluster thing. Microsoft's cluster is apparently of the AMD AI chips that can be sold through this cloud computing service of course that Microsoft has as you're here and ultimately for AI models and applications to run these businesses actually have to put together or cluster multiple GPUs here. So that from some of the great reporting out of Asia. Yeah it's interesting when it takes a look at ultimately what this could mean for AMD's business AMD expects four billion AI chip revenue this year has said that the chips are powerful enough to train and run those large AI models when you take a look at that and coupling that with exactly what this ultimately means here for this business here we are expected to hear a little bit more details when Microsoft does hold its event but clearly there is a lot of excitement surrounding the potential here of this partnership and what exactly that could ultimately mean here for both of these companies and then you've also got to ask what this could mean here for Nvidia as well and whether or not how much market share this could potentially take from them or pressure this could ultimately put on the business. Yeah I mean I guess with the clustering that takes place in data centers it's actually more advantageous to have multiple different types of chips running for the large language processing so that is something that is far over my head I would love to get an expert on that but no doubt the stock movement is not over my head you're taking a look at AMD shares as we were just a moment ago here up pre-market three and a half percent on this news and you've got to wonder how this company is also going to be drumming up some of the other major deals here that are similar or synonymous to what they've just been able to do with Microsoft year to date company up by about seventeen percent right now.
