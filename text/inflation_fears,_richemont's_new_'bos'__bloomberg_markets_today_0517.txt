well talk commodities copper surging demand seen growing energy transition well back subject back im confident time lift think going see momentum behind three sources demand time around meaning green capex ai plus military back 2021 green capex demand full force supplies inventories tight jeff curry chief strategy officer energy pathways copper demand copper story wider commodities landscape lets bring marcus garvey head commodities strategy macquarie group marcus thanks joining us friday morning appreciate copper jeff curry coming view could get 15 thousand thats thats kind target level terms pricing copper called cyclical upswing commodities back note back march upside 15 thousand sound reasonable think short term blunt maybe two three run scenarios high numbers become plausible think one things thats really striking us upswing youre currently currently experiencing prices actually beating expectations note put march even looking little bit back february started get constructive sector near term fundamentals lagging could argue markets pre pricing tightness thats still come evidently risk stage lot already price fundamentals dont catch quite quickly vulnerable correction stage really stress actually financial markets really driving price action near term physical lagging seeing look physical premiums look inventory developments maybe exception us copper market look import arbitrage china chinas apparent demand biggest single center demand major markets none actually particularly strong point financial market physical market thats making running ok marcus youre youre paying picture essentially kind speculative play point financial markets talk us demand supply dynamics fundamentals consequential putting kind fundamental flaw price china point think youve got separate little bit short term medium term point sense argument thats advanced agree copper strong medium term outlook debate quite strong means pricing think almost everyone would agree constructive comes back fundamental view looking right market degree pricing fundamental development expected come yet point gives issue longer dont see fundamentals really start deliver vulnerable catch example negative surprises either fundamental macro basis look peoples forecasts year copper market offer deficit large deficits even high six seven hundred thousand tons deficit estimate two hundred fifty thousand tons year date copper inventory almost four hundred thousand tons build seasonally first quarter year draw consistently second quarter year thats happening yet ability market get financial markets expecting starting look little bit challenged financial market might much soon theres lot spectators market point yes apply new york particular saw phenomenon spread new york price london price seems get stretched versus recent versus history barkers sounds youre saying shouldnt case think theres two aspects one exactly shouldnt shouldnt case sort sustainable basis theres reason time see premium new york anything outside normal sort physical arbitrage level saw briefly today go thousand dollars earlier week underlying cause large portion financial length sitting cme market new york argue macro discretionary sort generalist capital also systematic momentum funds investing copper addition key enabling move happened us market actually regionally tight right even context global market thats tight look asia x china look china domestic markets arent currently physically tight us sort degrees thats unsustainable clearly opened physical arbitrage takes bit time close say thats unsustainable look sort august september could easily find enough copper physically moving us close arbitrage think youve already seen people starting position physical market yes whether actually even see arbitrage still open come time probably function happens financial market side see bit positioning call back new york reduce degree arbitrage likely open may unwind ok yeah rather physically important keep mind regional dynamics describe kind bullish signal markers think bhp bid angle around copper business received takeover offer prepared strip almost parts business allow market value copper play thats bullish signal read think short term market perspective doesnt really tell much current market conditions quite clearly medium term basis evidently underlines bhps view course may wrong position fairly reasoned opinion current market valuation copper assets view low youre thinking copper sort build versus buy assets basis think assets cheat implicitly bullish signal copper price would add one caution though look corporate space time doesnt particularly consistent track record accurately forecasting copper price whether theyre right possibly broader debate marcus park story one side though better value want make copper play metal stock going get biggest kind return want make make story work im restricted say activities unfortunately terms sit within business quarry think general point would say youve got disentangle somewhat fact stocks trade sort future discounting basis ultimately physical market trade spot basis future expectation faked youre current conditions lot baked spot market big vulnerability physical commodity market weve seen numerous instances time lot speculative length comes often good reason much quickly find physical market quite susceptible pullback commodity price depends investment horizons quick question nickel nickel morning looks like weve problem new caledonia french trying gain control nickel obviously battery metal amongst things used armaments used various things nickel prices risen pretty sharply moment something short term story seeing obviously near term dislocation market impact something sustainable something read wider battery metal story well think mean nickel big consideration really respect happens new caledonia whats going really dominate supply side market happens indonesia key part recovery youve seen price lowest year date fact first quarter year particular indonesian exports quite weak lot disruptions around mining permit issuance following change leading following change president see particularly prices bounced back levels previously well cost curve weve moved youre level incentivizing supply picked back youre finding disruptions terms things like regulatory issues actually nickel market really get tight second half year think thats probably quite challenged unless find indonesian supplies persistently disrupted marcus want get views gold 20 percent last last 12 months see price action around gold evolving month months ahead much central bank buying story definitely central bank buying story really last two three years actually look major drivers think two biggest drivers really pushed gold price weve seen western investors theyve still somewhat sensitive increased interest rates theyve actually less sensitive historic relationships would suggest really held period rate hiking cycle underpinned lot gold price performance additional kicker really come strongly year chinese investors rather western investors adding bit pushing gold price sort time highs level gold price think thats good point think short term feels reasonably neutral us could make sort hundred dollar case either way next couple months look towards election think autumn could actually really key point golds price performance year think chinese investors active think things may changing weve seen policy announcements today housing market weak housing market weak equity market encouraged investment gold things may move around positive direction next months big feature concerned rb depreciation head election market pricing reasonable possibility president trump wins also still talking putting 60 percent tariffs chinese imports us implicit risk get period rb weakness election would think way hedged onshore investors capital thats onshore buy gold think theres good chance head autumn get strong chinese investor bid coming back experienced particularly april actually year could catalyst push gold another leg higher ok thats thats really really interesting marcus garvey head commodity strategy malkori group tying elections us gold price consumer least demand china really fascinating terms key drivers also cautionary terms price weve seen copper given lack
