 It seems almost unfair really that there's a success of TSMC ends up being what constrains it in the end possibly. Yeah exactly so this company has really been a favorite among many active managers in the region for really good reasons right. TSMC has a dominant leadership in technology and for this big AI trend and even after the 40 over 40 percent rally this year its valuation is still pedestrian about like 20 times compared to the other global semi players that are trading like around 28 times. But with that said a lot of the funds they face limitations in terms of how much they can hold for a single stock such as rules like usage, European Commission's regulatory framework that manages mutual funds. So with that when you look at all the active managers they are already holding TSMC is already the top holding and it was over 9 percent waiting so there's really not that much they can add on top of the current waiting and so you know the heavy and also TSMC in many Asia excluding Japan and benchmarks now is is about around like 8 to 10 percent waiting so it's kind of unfair but you know also to say that TSMC how has been doing is actually putting a technical hurdle for how much upside can go in the near term.
