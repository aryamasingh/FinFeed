 Snowflake is in talks to buy wrecker. I mean why not. Let's shuffle a billion dollar deal on the table for a Friday morning. Talk me through the reasoning and the rationale for the deal. Tom. Yeah. Just a mere billion dollars and the valuation part of this story is really really interesting. And I'll get to that shortly. So yes this is Snowflake which of course is the data analytics in the cloud business. The stock is down about 17 percent year today buying according to this report or at least in the process of doing a deal billion dollars for Reica which makes these large language models and a lot of these applications. So the idea would be that they absorbed this snowflake into their own business because this is a company snowflake that either gets disrupted by these AI models or has to adjust to it organically or by doing a deal like this. So we watch to see whether it closes the valuation part of this. Reica was started in twenty twenty two valued at three hundred million in twenty twenty three. And now it has this billion dollar price cap on it according to this reporting. We'll see if it closes. But again snowflake has to adjust and it seems like they're going to reica and reaching out. This deal helps to close the gap. Then that could be consequential.
