 How do you think Cory about you know you talk about AI competition geopolitically? How do you sort of think about who's ahead right now if you were asked in US or China? Oh, absolutely unquestionably what's going on in the US and why is that? Because there's freedom and creativity and people want to develop here. They want to develop in Silicon Valley in particular And that's where the smart people are. I mean, you know you were in the Bay Area for a long time and I've been there for even longer and There are there was so much excitement about AI right now and it's really a foundational Since you still live there has that doled it all that has six months 12 months only still ramping hasn't I was too much? excitement There will be Boston, but this this one really does feel different in that this is a real foundational change in what? The technology can do and you'll hit by the way, it's so interesting because you've seen these you'll hear that it's foundational It's paradigm internet mobile AI you you agree with that a hundred percent agree with that You see in the results one of the differences, you know AI and machine learning have been around for generations But there the chat GPT moment was an iPhone like moment It was a it was a Netscape browser moment it really showed us how things can are really going to change in the future and The the evolution in the last year is just jaw-dropping and you know you mentioned in video earlier We get results next week from Nvidia Nets It's going to be really interesting They I really expected them to to lower expectations and put a little damp on the fire a little bit last quarter They did quite the opposite and so this could be really interesting So I'm glad you brought up Nvidia because I actually I'm writing about Nvidia for tomorrow's morning brief newsletter Shade was plug, please that's a must-read finance more it is a must-read But I'll give you a little tease here like just looking at how much Nvidia's data center business has grown and Is expected to continue to grow and I was looking at other companies right if you look at other companies that have grown a lot in The past like Tesla had a year in 2013 when its sales were 387% But it didn't even have two billion dollars in sales and you're talking about company a company that is growing its sales on an annual basis doubling tripling But the sales are in the really big digits. Yeah, yeah, billions of dollars anything like this I mean has any other company been this big and been continuing to grown by this much We've never seen anything like this ever. There's nothing like it What's also interesting is that Nvidia and we'll see how this plays out But Nvidia's also jacked their gross margins in other words. They're selling everything they make they're making things as fast as they can They're inventing and iterating faster than than any chip company really has ever But they're also sticking into their customers and they're raising their prices so much Success and successfully because because you know used the old saying used to be no one ever got fired for buying IBM Well right now if you're building a data center you buy the Nvidia chips It's just what you do and whatever they're gonna charge you you're gonna you're gonna buy those chips So it doesn't matter if it's a build out happening with but but again you have all their customers many of their customers saying We're gonna start to design our own chips now. I doubt that Google Meta Amazon Are all gonna be able to create chips as good and as well as Nvidia has they're gonna It's hard to do it's the hardest thing maybe that's ever been done So they might not have the same kind of success But when all of your customers are trying to invent a competitor to the product They say that you are selling them you might want to worry about that So when video is they're taking they're making a lot of money They're taking a lot of profits and they're innovating at an incredible pace But their customers are don't like paying as much as they're paying
