Himars rockets are reportedly being jammed on occasion in Ukraine, and other GPS guided weapons systems. Briefly I understand that the last phase of potential impact is GPS guided and that it may only lose precision striking within GPS jamming spectrum potential, but there are so many complicated U.S. systems wherein their inherent complexity makes their opertation more susceptible to E.W. based jamming. Russia has reportedly been able to project conical E.W. based fields to protect certain areas, as a more recent example. My point is that Russia has grown significantly in it's E.W. capacity and the U.S. is either in lag pursuit of their capabilities or in proper targeted pursuit, but there is still a significant gap margin. At the peer advancement rate of both U.S. electronic signal complexity and Russia's seemingly extreme focus on attacking various signals, I am concerned about Link-16, and other highly important communcation capabilities being compromised in the future. Imagine if the future Valkryie drones and other automated systems were to be compromised; that would be truly terrible. I genuinely hate to leave this comment because it's based on concern. Don't get me wrong, I love all of these hi-tech new inventions, and this comment isn't ideal because the context is naval in nature but the U.S. has been so incredibly reliant on G.P.S. systems for so long, and their adversaries have been highlighting various ways to diminish their capabilities for possibly just as long, as well.\", \"Don't get why make tanks with so much weight of metal when ya can just sand bags on lighter metals for more speed to get out the way , want me to draw a blue print\", 'The Titan needs to be command destruct or self destruct.', 'The M-10 \"Booger\".

Besides this, all capital expenditure for these weapons create economy and jobs, enabling the US to also innovate and bolster technological development and industrial sectors of the economy. Each warhead is invaluable but if monetized, its certainly worth more than US treasury bills of the same price tag. Also deters a $100 trillion dollar nuclear offensive against the US mainland.\", \"All these are great, but my concern more than ever is the U.S. military's considerable lag behind Russia within the E.W. domain. Himars rockets are reportedly being jammed on occasion in Ukraine, and other GPS guided weapons systems. Briefly I understand that the last phase of potential impact is GPS guided and that it may only lose precision striking within GPS jamming spectrum potential, but there are so many complicated U.S. systems wherein their inherent complexity makes their opertation more susceptible to E.W. based jamming. Russia has reportedly been able to project conical E.W. based fields to protect certain areas, as a more recent example. My point is that Russia has grown significantly in it's E.W. capacity and the U.S. is either in lag pursuit of their capabilities or in proper targeted pursuit, but there is still a significant gap margin. At the peer advancement rate of both U.S. electronic signal complexity and Russia's seemingly extreme focus on attacking various signals, I am concerned about Link-16, and other highly important communcation capabilities being compromised in the future. Imagine if the future Valkryie drones and other automated systems were to be compromised; that would be truly terrible. I genuinely hate to leave this comment because it's based on concern. Don't get me wrong, I love all of these hi-tech new inventions, and this comment isn't ideal because the context is naval in nature but the U.S. has been so incredibly reliant on G.P.S. systems for so long, and their adversaries have been highlighting various ways to diminish their capabilities for possibly just as long, as well.\", \"Don't get why make tanks with so much weight of metal when ya can just sand bags on lighter metals for more speed to get out the way , want me to draw a blue print\", 'The Titan needs to be command destruct or self destruct.', 'The M-10 \"Booger\".
