medical workers are now facing dehydration and other deadly health conditions the intercepts ryan grim questioned state department spokesperson vident patel over the fate of the us doctors what does it say about conditions more generally in rafa and in kanyunas if american doctors only arrive there recently are already suffering from dehydration and malnutrition so look we have not been unambiguous about the humanitarian situation in gaza it is a crisis no amount of humanitarian aid at this moment is enough the state department spokesperson also criticized israeli settlers who were
