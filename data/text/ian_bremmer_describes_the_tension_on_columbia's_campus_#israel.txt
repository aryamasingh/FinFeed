 The context was challenging. There were probably a solid 15 or 20 percent of the graduating students that were wearing kafia in solidarity with the Palestinians, had Palestinian flags that they brought up onto the stage, and or had calls for divestment, a little wrapped up diploma types that they were handing to the dean conferring their certificates to them. So I mean, there's no question this was a hot issue and there were strong passions, but I will tell you not one student, not one student turned their back, not one student left the ceremony. Everybody applauded afterwards at the beginning of the speech. There were I heard some chanting, I heard some disruptions and I just said it was like almost as if there was a fight in a bar. I just like, Hey, hey, hey, like just I'm getting there. I hear you. I'm with you. Give me a second. I'll get there. And to their incredible credit, they did. They did. And over the course of the speech, you could see them willing to listen and engage. And that's been my experience with my students all year long. And that's been my experience on the Columbia campus.
