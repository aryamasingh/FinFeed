well underway hong kong next guest one speakers event corecipient 2018 nobel prize economic sciences joining us paul broma whos professor boston college previously served chief economist world bank paul great us know talk rate divergence lot global economies central banks mercy fed next perhaps want start comes interpretation inflation growth picture fine balance risks us moment yeah well theres one fact think helpful interpreting whats going raw inflation numbers month month strong seasonal pattern low end year monthly inflation rate much higher january february march even though try seasonal adjustment take effect effects theres tendency look every january february march say oh gosh losing fight inflation people confusing seasonals underlying trend past think youre going see recognition inflation united states least continues come maybe little bit slower people would like theres every reason confident well get need go also confident soft landing injured near know namely vet number economies struggling conundrum right sort support strength consumer retain gains labor market growth runaway point structural inflation becomes issue yeah well country going somewhat different united states benefited consensus need significant amount public investment public investment ever since covid providing real boost first stimulus payments public investment providing real boost us economy think odds soft landing high us also seem inflation expectations pretty well anchored blip associated war ukraine think odds us soft landing good think countries youve got look specifics see line differ relative us thinking though terms us consumer think weve looking instance saw confidence rising first time four months think perhaps overstating health us consumer given theres large part population thats really struggling rate increases yeah think may overstating little bit health consumer yet consumers really ones driving economy right really investment government key actor strategic reasons climate change reasons think theres every reason expect continue trade piece know youve spoken length know sort complex nature trade policy free trade doesnt always benefit come interesting juncture course industrial policy trade policy seeing lot things say necessary like sanctions like tariffs like export controls subsidies think parallel moves seeing eu china us right track well think theyre inevitable know covid made every country realize vulnerable outsourced offshore supply things like masks looming military conflict possibility conflict china made united states europe worried supply chips think theres going inevitable tendency try onshore certain kinds critical production activities beyond ive said mentioned theres growing recognition need something make sure economic growth benefits members society commitment free trade didnt characteristic always said well could supplement measure make sure nobody gets left behind never either get serious finding ways provide growth hope members us economy every economy means pulling back extent commitment free trade think inevitable well youve also talked less focus focus trade goods rather opposed focus trade ideas bit conundrum point take look tech like semiconductors like ai kind trade yep well thing thing remember deal done united states japan 70s 80s japan producing many cars higher quality us cars us said fine good us consumers well made cars using knowledge japanese manufacturers want cars made inside united states use mechanisms like direct foreign investment import knowledge country firm offshore developed still source goods production within borders example chips right investing intel also investing taiwanese manufacturers come set production united states seems like though theres also bit trade play focus perhaps reshoring building sovereign capacity areas also greater scrutiny seeing instance deals youve got instance nippons proposed take us steel thats possibly blocked point time yeah yeah yeah politics think hard distinction convey voters dont care owners corporation actually kind unclear exactly owns companies anyways care though manufacturing takes place little bit easy rhetoric become kind blanket hostility foreigners avoid benefit great deal direct foreign investment kind takeover proposed case think shouldnt resisted mentioned course focus intel chip makers sort leads really think ai story interesting commentary although course lot interesting commentary ai views really perhaps thinking around next big revolution could little bit misplaced yeah think remember solid consensus couple years ago cryptocurrencies going change everything suddenly consensus goes away nobody even asks gee confident blew think right theres way much confidence future trajectory ai whats clear ai made real progress things couldnt two years ago five years ago people project forward think theyre risk making serious mistake problem weve weve benefited scaling compute ingesting whole lot data scaling compute pretty easy machines chips whats going happen going enough data going get burst ingestion data isnt enough data keep rate progress going everybody seen recently already showing autonomous vehicles killer application ai cars would drive finding dont enough data rare events cause autonomous systems misbehave kill people rapid progress recently shouldnt extrapolated comparable process progress going forward things going slow lot also experiencing right lot hype typical bubble hype people trying cash latest trend promise talk two years going look back say yeah really bubble overestimated going heres new heres new thing hopefully wont two years speak wonder part froth say bubble obviously extraordinarily loose monetary policy framework past years right comes fed restriction us us capital rates know know ultimately change direction think thats going massive impact comes flow capital parts world emerging markets yeah well think good thing sure acknowledge little know economists anybody knows example saw burst inflation caused know war food prices energy prices almost everybody thought us thought fed would cause increase unemployment bring inflation wrong need admit dont always know whats going big uncertainty right real rates say fed funds rate minus inflation rate settle got used last decade two extremely low real rates period may anomaly tail end long process disinflation started paul volcker may going back normal period real rates positive good ways reduce risks kind speculative bubbles cause major readjustments people think largely investing assumption going go back essentially zero real rates right dont know everybody agrees inflation done going steady go dont know fed funds rate fed fund rate minus inflation inflation rate dont know number going suppose goes longer term kind structural nature price pressures look like right think sense long fed stays higher longer sucking capital away markets emerging markets think thats probably right way think think know fed needs think thing need clear clear fast want inflation come stipulate want inflation go lower theres still question happy process happens gradually time need get right away fed clear argument weve seen steady continuous decreases inflation theres reason aggressive risk causing causing recession fed say long coming happy think may even mean say happy need start unwinding interest rate increases know going sustained wherever fed funds rates stabilizes going level lower paul romer professor boston college thanks much youre watching insights well
