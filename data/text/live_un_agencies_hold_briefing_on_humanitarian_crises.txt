thank alessandra hi everyone know today launch report called climate change escalation global extreme heat report highlights role climate change played increasing number extreme heat days around world last 12 months today us dr frederike freddi otto world weather attribution imperial college london one coauthors report brief us also online colleague maya valberg another coauthor report red cross christian climate centre ready answer two questions particularly work done teams upcoming heat action day next sunday thank thank much dr otto talking coming us london understand yes thank go ahead yeah thank much going silent increasingly common killer particularly disastrous last year hate may sitting hotter every may may youve ever experienced true last 12 months tempersis right around 50 degrees india pakistan every heat wave thats happening today hotter lasts longer would without humaninduced climate change without burning coal oil gas also see many heat waves would otherwise report weve put together front today spells means matters course temperatures constitute extreme heat differs depending live heat wave london different heat wave delhi place earth spared extreme heat average inhabitant plan experienced 26 days last 12 months extremely hot would climate change course average people live specific place specific country example lived ecuador 26 days 170 days words last 12 months people ecuador experienced 180 days extreme heat without climate change would 10 six months extreme heat instead 10 days extreme heat dangerous leading excess mortality thousands least heat harms especially vulnerable people elderly young preexisting health conditions also healthy people exposed extreme temperatures like outer workers agriculture construction course people living refugee camps thus paramount stop burning fossil fuels evade situation getting worse also need adapt 26 days extreme heat average thats almost month heat kills doesnt kill many solutions low cost ranging individual action population scale interventions reduce urban heat island effect individual level people cool bodies selfdouwzing water using cooling devices modifying built environment install shatters increase shade course individual action alone sufficient especially lack access water electricity shade action community city regional country levels imperative cities develop implement heat action plans outline prepare heat season respond imminent heat waves plan future large scale policies introduced incorporate cooling needs social protection programmes supplement energy costs vulnerable building codes updated encourage better housing significant impact heat waves potential prevent rec cross rec crescent partners mobilising 2 june global heat action day dont know dangerous heat cant definitely matters need raise awareness engage anyone communities understanding combat heat answer questions role climate change extreme heat extreme weather colleague maya walbeck rec cross climate centre also answer questions vulnerability exposure thank thank much let see questions see jeremy lonche hi thank explain extreme heat technically speaking temperature consider talk extreme heat thats course difficult question ask extreme heat depends live also course vulnerable live city extremely well built heat high temperatures problem living refugee camp shade much lower temperatures consider extreme heat report defined extreme heat based place earth 10 highest temperatures occur region team well weather attribution done huge amount studies individual heat waves characterised heat depending impacts study extreme heat palestine israel jordan syria hot three days looked extreme heat meteorological extreme means rare usually look sort 10hottest percentage fifth hottest percentile done simplicity report much matters hugely depends vulnerability david fallop yeah meaning biological limit youre supposed go like body shouldnt temperature dont know 40something degrees couple hours couple days cant dont report particularly biological limit dont biological limit report biological limit based temperature also humidity dry heat wave 40 degrees thats much less damaging body humid humidity 100 35 degrees thats much damaging body dont many days yet globally biological limit heat deadly much much absolute biological limit therefore think measure would really characterize dangers heat waves today heat waves killing 10 average used maya please ed see maya wants say something yeah thank much wanted add important point raising friti heat waves extreme heat contextual always bring risk impact human health coming generally cold country sweden people often lot less prepared cope heat waves lack adequate infrastructure air conditioners cooling centres limited infrastructural resilience acclimatisation risk awareness populations areas may therefore susceptible also heat related impacts give example 2018 threeweek heat wave northern scandinavia reaching 31 degrees celsius sweden still estimated killed 600 people country older adults physiologically vulnerable heat think exemplifies worry temperatures may universally considered high extreme instead focus high exposed community definitely something want help raise awareness heat action day occurs sunday thank thank much maya question ifrc colleagues dont see room platform thank much
