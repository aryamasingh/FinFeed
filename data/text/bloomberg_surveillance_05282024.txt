q4 unless labor market nosedives recession see inflation rising back towards 4 percent end next year toms us tom thats quite cool whats driving well simply put labor market rigidity labor market weve seen last well say 10 20 years labor market looks lot like found 70s organized labor gaining power gaining steam every year 40 percent consumer base work yet consuming getting social security gains 3 percent also substantial portion labor force public sector thats getting wage gains 3 5 percent huge tailwind inflation wage inflation next years going go away period next months inflation continue come thats right least september obvious question forecast mean policy well part means odds policy mistake growing fed likely bite decline inflation see fall bite mean likely see rate cuts year think neil cashcarrie comments earlier week last week saying something effect wants see months declining inflation cut well think going get months think going get declining inflation least september maybe october enough fed cut likewise fed already begun ease look balance sheet theyre slowing pace treasury balance sheet reduction effectively thats cut policy already moving towards easing phase think

regardless policies based yearoveryear comparisons inflationary shift higher next year could cause say policy mistake fed cut year likely comes correction labor market dont see unemployment rising one 2 percent wage inflation going cause reacceleration broad inflation later history says happens 85 percent time youve seen inflationary shock like saw 2021 2022 doesnt driven goods inflation everybodys saying well weve beaten back goods inflation thats likely true havent beaten back wage inflation second wave inflation likely driven wage inflation next year beyond said 1970s get people little bit concerned see 1970s type moment say 1995 1996 lot people sort drawing comparison likely much like 70s really goes back rigidity labor market large skill mismatch employers demanding labor market wants

public sector unions years come theyve already negotiated theyre already pipeline 3 5 pay gains 2025 2026 2027 likely similar story social security effectively youre getting somewhere 25 35 pay gains social security households dependent upon may enough certainly keeps inflation migrating back 3 think irrespective whos white house youre going face sort potential second wave inflation also whos white house going get level tax cuts likely depending big based socioeconomic scale also corporate tax rate also tariffs see individuals potentially trump going lot bigger think get 10 tariff ring 60
