something like werent going write life wasnt interesting made change mind memoir come believe reluctant memoirist think good sign ever encounter enthusiastic memoirist run direction exposing personal traumas typically would involve people think reluctant write life would involve talking family feel compulsion eventually write memoir could finally make connections familys personal experiences larger historical tapestries ive spent career life grappling big political questions race colonization scale otherness hopefully sign maturity human ive also come able recognize otherness also taking place vast scales also intimate scales sometimes people people right next parents family difficulty writing memoir understand ordinariness site intense conflict able excavate enough tell honest story minor experience might surprised many people identify think trivial exterminate brutes theres line knowledge lack guess question confront kind willful ignorance selfinflicted amnesia really seems dominate lot debates past well wish could optimistic think losing fact one chapters film like arrogance ignorance title science respected numbers respected im working film well two two five people

horrifying things done yet capacity speech intervention think tremendous impact coming intellectual political awakening college led understanding hollywood unofficial ministry propaganda american soft power think important american hard power exercising american domination vast concept intimate connection movies bombing intellectual emotional sense understanding enraged theres repetition modes domination power subjugation would allow someone like berlin 1970s recognize situation pertinent makes think anger rage steady never go away within lifetime thats depressing also energizing wondering emotions power artist said anger rage theres emotions first instigation want writer anger reaction injustice reaction dumbness bulliness im talking empire killing nations maybe come haiti proud

people dying thats difficult world living impossible put names definitions things definitions like opinion everybody see atrocities committed youve described intention people would say oh theres intention theres proven intention israel state deliberately engaging genocide disagree idea obviously many genocidal statements given israeli ministers political leaders intentionality displayed videos israeli soldiers recorded find experience really strange think human also writer theres text thats said spoken israel us supporters israel saying selfdefense humanitarian reasons prevent antisemitism yet theres clear subtext see bombing thats taking place massacres find absurd somehow us see subtext supposed ignore focus text thats provocative writer think capacity literature filmmaking art try respond immediate moment happening debilitating think insufficiency something like literature respond moment crisis ways retrospective literature like maybe years someone could write novel palestinian perspective doesnt make give literature make feel inadequate human see images people recording phones beaming social media critical little ago images social media allow us kind
