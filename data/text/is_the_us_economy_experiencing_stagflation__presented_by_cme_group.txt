 On May 1st, the rumblings of stagflation began. That was the day we saw declines in the ISM manufacturing and new orders component coinciding with a jump in prices paid. Stagflation is the very undesirable situation where employment and demand are declining at the same time inflation is accelerating. It's a tough situation for the Federal Reserve to be in as they are torn between cutting rates to avoid recession or raising rates to avoid inflation. The employment data on May 3rd added some fuel to the growing narrative as it came in significantly lower than expected. The discussion may have been put on hold though after the highly anticipated PPI and CPI releases on May 14th and 15th. The PPI caused an initial shock as the headline was higher than expected but the downward revisions to the previous months took away some of the stings and suggested that perhaps the series had a lag effect and that some inputs were just catching up. The CPI came in slightly lower than expected at plus .3 month over month and seemed to add to the growing relief as equities rallied. There are still two things that could reignite the stagflation narrative. One if the government accelerates spending further or oil prices rises significantly.
