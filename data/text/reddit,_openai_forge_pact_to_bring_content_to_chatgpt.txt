 Symbiotic is the word that comes to mind. Mutually beneficial for one another. Who gets what in this deal, Tom? Good morning. Yeah, absolutely, Manus. It is a two-way deal, because, of course, OpenAI gets that data that, of course, Reddit has described as very valuable in the past and the lead-up to its IPO in March. OpenAI gets the data from the Reddit social media platform and is able to train on that. We know there is a data deficit right now for these large language models, so that's helpful for chat GBT, of course, the product that OpenAI is behind. What Reddit gets is some of the use cases, so some of those models and some of those top-line software applications that are going to be built in now to the Reddit platform that have been designed and created by OpenAI. So it is symbiotic. And, of course, the pitch that Reddit had made up until and then the lead-up to that March IPO was, we have this valuable data, we can sign these licensing deals, and that's going to bring in the revenue. And so far, they've signed deals worth about 200 million. We don't know the value of this deal. A deal they struck with Google, for example, about 60 million. So they are living up to this. And as you said, the share price has reacted. It's up, what, 65% since the IPO? Interestingly, Sam Altman of OpenAI used to be the CEO of Reddit for a short time in 2014 and was one of the largest shareholders up until and leading up to that IPO. So these two companies know each other very well.
