shalom opened eris crossing opened zechim crossing opened ashdod opened trucks coming jordan coming israel making directly northern gaza intervention united states friday trucks un trucks allowed move egypt israel karim shalom ultimately onto people need fully reject premise dont think supported facts history thank matt two quick questions leave hour one called behind podium many times protection palestinian civilians gaza tell us safe zones name identify safe zones gaza people go would leave governor israel speak obviously mawasi one know designated others maps publicly available would leave speak okay second cofounder human rights watch holocaust survivor actually born nazi germany said yesterday wanted quote said period time israel obstructed delivery humanitarian assistance victims

argument cofounder human rights watch holocaust survivor let first say respect humanitarian situation course dire doubt longterm impact especially children gaza going severe going paying price suffering conflict years years come course even speak families left without loved ones including children died course conflict judgment continues judgment israel committing genocide nothing done meets legal definition seen take steps allow humanitarian assistance seen put place measures try minimize civilian harm spoke released national security memo 20 report israeli lawyers integrated targeting

continues hide behind civilians course lot israel needs take additional steps minimize civilian harm minimize civilian suffering continue press okay take question investigative reporting guardian magazine 972 basically saying israel last 10 years 9 years pressurizing icc spying response us youre saying ally pressuring international legal entity thats trying try people crimes humanity war crimes read report think important say verified point dont want speak hypotheticals united states may may course would oppose threats intimidation public official thank go ahead tom examples internal israeli idf investigation led meaningful accountability know number ongoing investigations conflict still relatively new number investigations led criminal prosecutions course step relates broad scope israeli investigations years know places people held accountable know places conflict example disciplined officers example filming inside mosques im happy follow specifics instances mean ask question youre hanging awful lot faith process example national security memorandum 20 report talk convinced israels quote credible reliable assurances mean two cases american citizens killed hands idf meaningful accountability think people perhaps puzzled belief assurances believe process making lasting judgments yet process yield theyre ongoing ongoing many past ongoing reached conclusion also create situation youre able get holding pattern say ok theres investigation going well hold judgment alternative shortcircuit investigation pass judgment middle one also appropriate im asking pass judgment current incidents im saying evidence meaningful accountability evidence things prevented happening follows humair saying basis internal israeli processes huge amount weighs international criminal court one objections independent internal process icj thing nsm20 thing incidents hanging belief process effective im asking evidence let level set israel democracy prosecutors independent judges case prosecutors conduct investigations make determinations appropriate know want dont want put words mouth hate people let take back dont want put words mouth know often demand us try jump end investigation get point youre making im asking evidence effective reach conclusion results investigations middle conflict faith process able look outcomes generated place conflict 100 years old current form probably 40 50 years old idf says internal system says process internal investigation im asking evidence effective stops happening creates accountability example last two years two american citizens killed meaningful accountability time israelis said investigation relied well cited one case officers disciplined taking actions inside mosque number similar cases publicly reported think impossible pass full lasting judgment process youre middle get point making position declare investigations israel conducting sham investigations theyre ongoing dont think fair would object someone respect military justice system investigations ongoing six months nine months wherever end process reasonable amount time passed able look say investigations run course think action warranted action taken first say publicly first hold israel accountable seen us instances example comes violence west bank dont think israel taken appropriate actions hold people accountable taken actions hold people accountable thats standard continue apply mean think military court system cases palestinians appear 99 conviction rate cases israelis held separately civilian system dont territory appear military system rights groups say white washes virtually accountability investigation think im going wait said see outcome investigations ongoing pass judgment house go ahead thank matt two topics
