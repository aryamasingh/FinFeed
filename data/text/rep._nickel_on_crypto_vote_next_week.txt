 you know if you're looking for good examples of bipartisan cooperation our work in the house financial services committee on digital assets is just that uh... this bill the fit for the twenty first century act uh... the first ever you know uh... regulatory structure for uh... digital assets is coming to the floor for a vote next week i was part of a group of six democrats who worked with my republican colleagues in committee to move this bill similar group of uh... democrats in the ag committee as well so we're gonna vote next week i'm very excited because uh... we we are operating on a hundred-year-old security law securities law for this industry and we need to take it regulations in place we need to protect consumers and that's what this bill does congressman it's good to have you back we haven't asked you about margie taylor green yet yes as far as crypto is concerned what does the white house not understand on this legislation you know i think the white has had a great executive order on web three i think i think you know gary gensler in the scc are really at odds with a lot of others in the administration so i've been very frustrated with gary gensler and the scc's regulation by enforcement and and frankly just open hostility towards crypto so we're seeing that play out i was part of a group of twenty one democrats who voted for the s a b one twenty one c r a on the house floor uh... last week but just yesterday we saw twelve senate democrats agreeing with us that the scc is way out of line and out of step uh... including senator schumer as part of that group of twelve democrats so i think that's a great message and my hope is that gary gensler will will see the writing on the wall and rescind s a b one twenty one he has the ability to do that and really what he's doing is making you know the putting the president in a very difficult position forcing him to choose size he is not serving president biden's best interest so what he can do is he can withdraw it and work on cut the custodial banking peach which is really that the big policy point here that that we want to get right so that you know where we we have you know bitcoin ETFs we want our u s highly regulated banks to be able to custody those assets and he's prohibiting them from doing that well congressman you were there speaking of the twelve democrats in the senate who decided to vote in favor of this legislation yesterday and i wonder what your message is as a democrat who is not running for reelection to those that are and how they should be considering crypto in in their policy considering say the chair of the senate banking committee shared brown is very vulnerable in ohio he's running against a pro-crypto advocate in bernie marino there is tens of millions of dollars in crypto super PAC money that could be mobilized against candidates like him is it a mistake for incumbent democrats not to be pro-crypto right now i think it's a mistake for this become a partisan issue twenty percent of registered voters own crypto uh... you know it's the this this industry is not going away and and the message i have is whether you love crypto or you hate crypto you should want to have regulations that's our messages democrats that's what the the work i'm doing in a bipartisan way does we we provide regulations for this industry and uh... we don't what i don't want to see is this become a part of a partisan political issue because uh... web three should not be at all congressman i'm not going to ask you about margaret taylor green specifically but when we look at the the whole story here and what's been happening in the house of representatives the breakdown in decorum the dysfunction that so many people talk about people should know that you're a freshman congressman who's in fact in his senior term you're leaving the house and we can get into the reasons why but i wonder if a you're happy to be leaving because of the environment that's your surrounded in the the workplace culture if we can call it that in the u.s. house and be if you're on your way out of this body right now you can do anything you want are you doing the risky business dance in the rotunda like what do you do when you have free reign on your way out the door well you know i i i'm not that retiring voluntarily my district at jerry manard away from me i love you i love this job i have a lot more work i want to get done so we're working twice as hard to get things done while i'm still in congress uh... there's future elections for me but uh... that the point that that i think is really important for anybody watching that the chaos and confusion that we see playing out in congress there is one thing to blame and you can put your finger right on it and and and it's it's clear as day it's extreme partisan gerry manard i got elected to congress in a republican seat was a you know a slightly republican seat could gone either way i won by three points because pro-democracy republicans made their voices heard and voters had a real choice and gerry manard is wrecking congress less than ten percent of the seats are competitive the other ninety percent only going to go to whoever wins the democratic primary or the republican primary that's how members of congress are designed right now is they are just mainly here to win their democratic primary when their republican primary that's why you see all these food fights and the crazy stuff you see in in oversight because that's their focus less than ten percent are truly competitive we won one of those the answer is non-partisan independent redistricting that would totally change the face of congress you would get so many more people who are just focused on getting things done and working across the aisle that's what we need a lot more of and we're gonna have fewer and fewer seats uh... they're like that we're losing mine that's one example and uh... uh... it's it's the the thing that we got a change if we want to get sanity back in congress
