 Here are three things you may have missed in China this week. President Xi Jinping welcomed Russian leader Vladimir Putin to China on a two-day state visit. Putin is seeking to ensure support for his government with the war in Ukraine now in its third year. Beijing is considering a proposal to have local governments across the country buy millions of unsold homes, according to people familiar with the matter. It would be one of the country's most ambitious attempts yet to salvage the ailing property market. China blasted President Joe Biden's sweeping tariff hikes on a range of its imports, including electric vehicles, semiconductors and solar cells. While the latest measures affect areas where China only has a small segment of the US market, Foreign Minister Wang Yi called it a classic example of bullying.
