triton sailboat turned submarine thats powered solar panels last year traveled mississippi triton made learn wsjs equipped series inequipped wsj explores latest military innovations tactics around world breaking weapons potential impact tech behind drone us navy operating near iran carry various payloads sail autonomously months time want learn weapons click link pinned comment watch latest episodes equipped early might look like toy boat part growing class militaryuse drones ocean arrow triton build autonomous vessel sail surface dive operate submarine mode designed stealthy triton currently used us navy middle east us focused deterring iran time scale new pentagon initiative buy thousands unmanned systems coming months tritons soon used counter adversaries worlds waters triton several features ocean arrow says makes useful us military one loaded least five cameras help spot enemies problems water powered 740 watts solar panels enable sail autonomously three months time payload areas carry different sensors weapons making capable various missions thing sets apart drone boats according ocean arrows ceo kevin decker dual modality ability sail surface think adversaries scared technology know think theyre definitely concerned anything watch cant find doesnt want found concern boat got better sense triton looks operates water 14 feet long 25 feet wide triton designed low radar visual signature making hard adversaries detect gray color helps boat blend environment water dive beneath surface triton lowers wing gradually fills water descends eventually disappearing view doesnt need human prompt ocean arrow says triton autonomously recognizes ships threats consider possibility adversary could scoop triton water yes absolutely one highest benefits dual modality vehicle one dive sail get way youre trying evade adversary get way surface energy able dive tantamount success survivability triton costs 2 3 million depending payloads purchased sail speeds five knots par sailboats slower many vessels used navies captured considered worstcase scenario triton like many commerciallymade drones considered tritable essentially means cheap enough lose triton basically cost tomahawk missile inexpensive would say right sweet spot triton hasnt logged many operational hours drone boats company racing catch competitors terms developing advanced capabilities guys working think future next 12 24 36 months going look like smarter tritons want get intercontactivity swarm basis using tritons together triton weaponized think dependent upon mission customer wants go thats decide right us provide platform deliver payloads decide want put inclusive weapons cameras anything else want watch watch triton used us task forces middle east triton saw persian gulf last year us navy paired triton unmanned drone boats artificial intelligence expand eyes ears water navy operators defense experts say triton autonomous vessels like could used offensive defensive purposes like protecting ports naval bases jamming attacking finding neutralizing sea mines laying monitoring underwater pipelines communications cables disrupting defending navy ships assets destroying drones also used intelligence surveillance reconnaissance purposes like identifying flagging threats communications purposes like creating 5g network sea ukraine cheap drone boats shown value time time attacking russias infrastructure large ships alter balance power black sea drones around years military analysts criticized pentagon moving slowly comes adopting range unmanned artificial intelligence technologies acknowledging need innovate urgency deputy defense secretary kathleen hicks announced replicator initiative summer plan buy thousands air sea landbased drones next two years opportunity gamechanging shift long pursued ocean arrow counts investors like lockheed martin betting growing interest maritime drones us partners abroad countries interested technology contact australia united kingdom discussion india taiwan three weeks ago met members coast guard navy clearly large need given geopolitical situation keep demand company built new factory mississippi three two one mark opening states governor us senators going key part keeping nation safe senator roger wicker ranking member armed services committee said drones must deployed quickly deter china leader communist party china said wants country ready 2027 retake taiwan given xis timeline would say race get systems taiwan strait absolutely would long start finish takes three weeks build fully complete triton ocean arrow says plans build 100 tritons year new space together another location next door says could crank 600 year needed kind growth forecasting think whole industry poised explosive growth think aerial drones 20 years ago ocean drones today given new us shift toward unmanned systems decker says hes optimistic future pentagon hasnt announced specific acquisition plans replicator ocean arrow one many commercial drone companies competing orders first time four decades us army unveiled wholly new armored fighting vehicle m10 booker fully traversable turret armed 105millimeter main gun army officials called new light tank many say mission protection booker different tank heres compares tanks like abrams us sending ukraine army invested 1 billion equip new vehicle booker looks similar abrams fully tracked vehicles fourperson crew 360degree turret largecaliber main gun commanders independent thermal viewer allows visibility night multiple directions booker half weight latest abrams tank battlefield role m10 support deployed infantry forces booker basically gives armor support would otherwise carry wider variety munitions go places uparmored humvee cant go tracked vehicles distribute weight effectively better offroad performance bookers road wheels even lighter previous tracked vehicles similar size allows move easily around battlefield common choke point heavier tanks like abrams bridges example could support booker support abrams also means booker deployed aircraft relatively easily 31 m1a1 abrams promised ukraine delivery could one biggest challenges one abrams fit inside c17 globemaster compared two bookers order get vehicle weight class army strategic level armor look turret booker compared abrams see roof turret particular actually armor turret connects gun main body vehicle turret front usually thought part vehicle likely hit enemy abrams turret well protected bookers turret probably fairly well protected expectation would survivable abrams even less protection booker bring new capabilities infantry forces main gun nearly 105 mm cannon thats smaller abrams 120 mm main gun powerful 25 mm cannon m2 bradley gives flexibility firing projectiles specifically designed penetrate armor booker also comes equipped highly accurate targeting system essentially vehicles computer computer used detect range target using laser calculate fire gun hit target including moving including youre moving less armor might also explain key difference two engine placement case booker would mean engine sits front crew potentially provides additional protection vehicle hit front chance crew would likely survive hit abrams simply great deal front armor balances engine back compared abrams gas turbine engine burning like 12 gallons fuel hour turned bookers 800 horsepower diesel engine meant extend fuel time full 24 hours vehicle idling burn much less fuel factors weight armor main gun engine play two differ deployment booker necessarily designed go toe toe enemys heavy armor top tier main battle tanks adversary armored vehicles would want booker abrams armored brigade combat team armored brigade combat team considered heavy force booker hand meant work ground troops infantry brigade combat team military experts say team designed quick deployment able operate highly restrictive terrain like jungles forests mountains cities advantage infantry go lots places lots ability see things sneak around effectively fighting environment difficult terrain communicate dangerous targets tank crew members operating vehicle find rather familiar booker abrams made company general dynamics land systems share features helpful ways told similar controls crew members shared characteristics allow seamless training familiar tankers basically use similar crew drill booker abrams compartmentalized ammunition design intended protect crew ammunition explodes helps vehicles avoid jackinthebox explosion seen many russian tanks war ukraine ammunition stored around turret exploded likely killing crew causing turret fly arrival booker comes time new challenges arisen tanks combat vehicles alike modern armored vehicles attacked literally direction right ukraine vehicles worrying artillery drones might attack top vehicle deal mines would attack bottom vehicle course direct fire threats come direction army grew interested building vehicle like booker years russias annexation crimea experts noting need mobile protected firepower light modern russian warfare actually making booker reality hasnt cheap last summer general dynamics contracted production fielding nearly 100 vehicles 114 billion deal extending contract include additional 26 vehicles adding another 258 million vehicle run issues early tests found high levels toxic fumes firing main gun army pretty high expectations ready vehicle reaches soldiers theres issue soldier safety problem fumes main gun actually dealt according office works acquisition theyll deal green light production first unit m10 bookers expected toward end 2025 systems expected cost around 13 million plans cost go production increases price doesnt perfectly compare estimated 10 million abrams unlike abrams booker new build difference newest version abrams original version abrams night day abrams literally got gun different main gun installed went m1 m1a1 first iteration booker fills important gap armys capabilities intended serve longterm solution thing fielded almost certainly subsequent changes give vehicle like bunch soldiers find ways break need fix find things improve go back army ultimately hopefully turn booker a2 better version air force planning spending 130 billion replace cold warera intercontinental ballistic missiles new modern iteration sentinel missile replacement could boost us nuclear defense strategy doubts cost logistics new systems even head air force like types videos click link pinned comment air force spending 100 billion replace new modern iteration sentinel missiles concerns process replacing even head air force sentinel think quite honestly struggling little bit heres icbms fit uss nuclear strategy work challenges replacing mounting icbms make land leg uss nuclear defense strategy called nuclear triad two legs submarines sea bombers air submarines going great stealthy quality bombers greatest flexibility terms taking different routes flexibility terms recalling firing benefit icbms location necessarily fact theyre distributed theyre distributed silos across five states 40000 square miles 450 silos spread number states american west creates massive targeting problem side kill 450 silos would devote 800 900 weapons around numbers air force says minuteman missile travel 5000 miles 30 minutes missiles designed four main parts first large rocket second third smaller yet still powerful rockets fourth nuclear warhead covered protective shroud first large rocket allows missile pull away earths gravity warhead jettisons shroud second third motors push top earths atmosphere nuclear warhead reenter atmosphere reach detonation site minuteman missiles although continuously upgraded 50 years old losing reliability solid rocket motors tend crack problems theyve sitting cold silo say decades end sentinel icbms set replace work like minuteman missiles new outer bodies made carbon composites instead heavier steel potentially allowing nuclear warheads changes like may allow sentinels upgraded easily estimated 50year lifespan opposed opening silo door going plugging things side missile facilities going permit much better efficient way updating system updated missiles facilities arent cheap updating silos complex anticipated thats problem air force sentinel program projected cost 96 billion air force says track spend 130 billion see map one three silo fields launch silos copper communication wire connecting much land privately owned air force buy areas order rebuild silos modern technology replace wiring probably biggest thing ways air force ever taken vast real estate development air force pentagon broadly fighting perhaps didnt take account enormous efforts would required another weakness sentinels tech could potentially easier hack minuteman missiles according one analyst compared icbm first deployed 1971 five years ago still using form large floppy disk sentinel going 21st century missile every respect hack minuteman missile enemy would dig copper communication wire manually splice get launch theres actually kind benefit theres beauty simplicity really hard hack analog system 1970s since sentinels significantly software minuteman missiles officials taking precautions like upping boundary security would say enormous amount attention paid looking potential vulnerabilities nuclear command control terms sentinel theyre going make sure resilient kind thing increasing security vast real estate acquisitions led project going 37 budget means reviewed department defense congress called nunmccurdy breach dod hundreds programs going given time since 2007 nunmccurdy couple dozen breaches since breaches significant review incredibly detailed decide whether sentinel project continue lawmakers arguing expensive estimates well 150 billion purpose make us safer wont make us safer air force office secretary defense say three legs triad essential american nuclear defense pentagon review due summer 2024 military experts say unlikely halted every presidential administration since end cold war taken look kind scratched heads says hey really need three different legs triad turns every single administration looking comes back says well actually yes late november guided missile destroyer uss carney shot drone launched houthicontrolled territory yemen one month earlier ship intercepted several drones cruise missiles fired houthis carney destroyers sent middle east carrier strike groups deter houthis militant group like hezbollah getting involved israelhamas war carney spot shoot drones missiles else could destroyer numerous defensive systems come play conflict destroyers like uss carney purposes experts say main one protect carrier strike group aircraft carrier several ships travel together use automated fully integrated combat system called aegis ddg destroyers really defined aegis combat system brains pulls elements together aegis reference zeuss protective shield ancient greek mythology connects various weapon systems board radar missile launch systems contributing offensive defensive operations

automatically track 100 targets simultaneously pick something going deposit energy develop track figure hey classified hostile radar detected identified threat aegis works systems intercept aegis communicates mk41 vertical launch system multicell module built hull ship fire almost kind navy missile rapidfire capability enables destroyer effectively handle numerous incoming missiles case october houthi attack vertical launch system deployed sm2s intercept four missiles fundamentally sm2s antiair effector think going cruise missiles going aircraft also well handful things sm2s range 90 nautical miles reach altitude 65000 feet spy1 communicates missiles guide midflight illuminating target missile home two systems combined first level defense destroyers like uss carney theyre capable handling many scenarios principle layered defense fundamental would say aegis philosophy systems well one systems seawiz closein weapon system missiles talked going much greater reach whereas getting something else might missed seawiz defense carrier strike group ship last ditch effort kill whatever might threatening ship two types uss carney may carry phalanx searam fire different ammunition essentially work way first search antenna provides information potential target like range velocity altitude sends information seawiz computer determines whether engage point mount moves face target track antenna kicks views smaller area extremely precise track antenna observes target computer finds maximal chance successful hit system either fires automatically recommends firing operator phalanx equipped shortrange 20millimeter gun fire 3000 4500 cannon rounds per minute experts estimate searams range 6 miles instead gatling gun searam launcher fires 11 rolling airframe missiles reach supersonic speeds experts say since systems ships last line defense theyre given little time react seawiz may couple seconds one chance protect ship hit thats system works best one several layers defense always good different systems different effects begin thin herd youre putting eggs one basket experts say carrier strike groups deployment red sea exemplifies us strategy prevent conflict expanding defend israel without putting troops ground different us destroyer shot drone fired yemen recent weeks destroyers also possess number offensive capabilities including 5inch 54caliber gun mounted ship ability deploy antiship harpoons tomahawk cruise missiles sorts offensive strike missiles used means weve entered different stage conflict would presumably side shooting involvement opposed kind aiding assisting serving defensive partner carrier strike groups destroyers play many roles projecting power chief among us certainly sending message sometimes communicate messages actions talking softly sending big ship thats know part overall message whats happening 155millimeter artillery shell one key ammunition used ukraine military officials estimate ukraine needs 200000 month actually fight war keep par russia us capacity somewhere around 28000 therefore large deficit war gaza broke israeli army using type artillery shell kyiv said deliveries vital ammunition gone since conflict started heres 155millimeter round became one soughtafter artillery calibers world us allies ramping production 155millimeter artillery shell adopted nato standard calibre second world war military experts defence intelligence firm jains say shell became popular balances range warhead size damage target 155millimeter round mainly used western haueitzer systems essentially looks like large bullet made steel casing fuse explosive fill standard round two feet long weighs 100 pounds 155 millimeters six inches diameter 155 basically measurement measures back shell pretty much want long caliber therefore fits barrel fire 155millimeter shell configured many ways packed highlyexplosive material produce highfragmentation use precisionguided systems within something like excalibur shell runs gps look fins come actually guide flight major producers also experimenting shells range something called ramjet shell works using oxygen comes front oxidizes fuel therefore needs less fuel go norwegian weapons manufacturer namu developing ramjet shell partnership boeing says new ammunition able travel 90 miles thats six times standard shell cover 15 miles ukraine 155millimeter shell quickly became one requested munitions allies started send artillery systems kyiv since 2022 kyiv received 300 western howitzers us provided 2 million rounds ammunition artillery hugely important ukraine war russia brought large artillery assets ukraine obviously followed suit thing long moment quite static front line artillery good people realize countries dont vast stockpiles missiles variety reasons one theyre complex expensive make since war ukraine broke price standard 155millimeter shells gone 2100 8400 apiece according nato officials still much cheaper missiles cost millions dollars like storm shadow missiles used ukraine nato estimates russia fires 30000 artillery rounds per day five times ukraine respond military experts say western arsenals ready artillery battle intensity stockpiles werent particularly high west realized didnt really capacity fill gaps quickly became problematic soon us europe south korea main manufacturers 155millimeter shell russias invasion ukraine us army owns ammunition production facilities states produced 14000 shells month since 2022 washington pumping billions dollars retooled factories produce rockets missiles shells rocket motors issued almost 25 billion contracts armed ukraine replenish us stocks year half production 155millimeter shell doubled 2025 washington plans produce 80000 shells month according army officials hand eu factories producing ammunition privately owned struggled provide ukraine shells us army say know want shells obviously prioritize european manufacturers said despite huge demand theyre getting actual orders saying want amount shells amount time theyre getting orders looking future would give confidence expand capacity israels war hamas militants created new challenges global supply ammunition december us sent roughly 57000 rounds 155millimeter artillery shell israel defense secretary lloyd austin said us able support ukraine israel military experts also note israeli operations gaza dont rely artillery heavily ukraine suggesting effects war gaza global demand 155millimeter shell could limited israel uses lot munitions ukraine doesnt really uses lot missiles uses air force ukraine order combat ammunition shortages ukrainian minister strategic industries announced december kiev agreed two american firms jointly manufacture 155millimeter shells ukraine however production wont start least two years problem supplying ukraine building stockpiles well obviously western countries need theyve promised massive increases european union shown thats difficult achieve one would imagine us weapon arrive ukraine soon according us defense official groundlaunched smalldiameter bomb 250pound class weapon capable reaching targets 90 miles away glstb accurate strike target within one meter unlike longrange missile systems like atacoms groundlaunched smalldiameter bomb comes considerably lower price think glstb kind middle goldilocks missile gives case ukrainians greater reach greater standoff much lower cost greater numbers heres groundlaunched smalldiameter bomb gets lot bang buck groundlaunched smalldiameter bomb new precisionguided weapon attaches m26 rocket us airlaunched version test groundlaunched version sending ukraine particular munition bit innovation takes something united states thousands lying around thats smalldiameter bomb essentially straps rocket motor back fires standard rocket launchers united states allies bomb range 94 miles fired multiple types launchers like m270mlrs heimars already supplied us ukraine flexibility means use deceptive enemy russians wouldnt necessarily know heimars launcher gimlers glstbs atacms frankly could mixing matching things want use uncertainty benefit ukrainians bombs unpowered equipped wings allow glide targets glide feature allows come nonpredictable angle shoot axis come side behind youre russians air defenses pointed one particular sector one direction might looking every direction take ability glide target attach rocket agent back sudden youve got range youve got little bit speed dont fly aircraft pilot much closer target glstb flies slower atacms ballistic missiles makes likely spotted adversaries also allows precise youre trading speed get greater range get greater accuracy get different flexibility approach target glide bomb ability maneuver advanced guidance combination gives ability hit difficult reach targets like inside caves precision guided munition means maneuver endgame get exactly pretty close exactly want come kind curve around come behind come kinds different trajectories well different attack angles opens possibility get things terrain urban areas might otherwise really hard get something ballistic artillery 250 pounds glstb warhead smaller 500 pound atacms warhead effectively reach targets big atacms still pretty sizable principle sort targets could use diverse anything would otherwise use small diameter bomb could softer targets could things sitting airfield could penetrating hardened bunker glstb also number fusing options allow operator select bomb detonate tell stb explode particular designated height altitude tell explode instantly hits something tell penetrate little explode useful different kinds targets different options well exact price glstbs unknown cost far less longrange missile systems like atacms ukrainians shooting 600070008000 artillery rounds day unit cost things matter also affects much united states folks afford purchase ukrainians abundance affordable munitions allows whats known structured attacks perhaps might want multiple glstbs coming time different directions thats really going complicate hopefully overwhelm target perhaps might launch slower weapons first start coming different angles time faster moving ballistic gimlers ray attack come everything arrives time prospect structured attacks really confuse overwhelm defender begins get pretty interesting glstb wont ukraines powerful longestrange weapon add significant flexibility attack operations well capacity wings really give flexibility aerodynamic maneuverability whichever direction whichever axis want come may able launch way way begin glide come back behind different directions glstb could powerful tool slow moscows continued assaults ukraine lower cost existing stockpile means ukraine could get although unclear many glstbs us deliver taking stuff thats lying around inventory putting together innovative way excess surplus bombs marrying rockets lying around probably need produce rockets sure good news lot stbs stockpile eventually run looking perfect solution looking good enough solution looking solution keeps ukrainians away defeat pushes russians back really putting particular munition within much larger picture ukraine repel invader russias tos 1a nicknamed scorching sun rockets produce fiery explosion burns hot consumes atmospheric oxygen path even person survives initial blast incendiary effects secondary fragmentation chance would suffocate human rights advocates pushing use restricted russia deployed stock dozen ukraine start war defense experts said ukraines best course
