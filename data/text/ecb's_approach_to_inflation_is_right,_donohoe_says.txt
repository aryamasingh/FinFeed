 How difficult, given the underlying pressures of fragmentations, of kind of shifting AI, is it to reach the 2% target? It is complex, but I do believe that it's a path available for that to happen. If you look at where we are at the moment last year, we would have seen inflation in the Euro area just above 3%. I believe across this year we'll see it at around 2.5%. And if I look at next year, on current economic forecasts, let's say the European Commission, I believe it would be close to 2%. So I do believe it's a path towards achieving that. Fiscal policy within the Euro area is not contributing to where we are with inflation, with challenges at the moment. And I think the approach the ECB have at the moment is frankly the right one. It's a complex changing world. Let's look at the data every month, every quarter, and see where we are then. Of course I know the ECB is independent. I know you're not also a markets guy. But actually when you look at, once there's a cut, does it make a difference if we continue cutting to how people think about Europe, how people think and connect actually with politicians? I think it will make a difference. But as against that, what also makes a very significant difference, which was a real risk in recent years, that we saw the risk of inflation becoming embedded into our economies and our politics, with all of the impact on the cost of living for households, for businesses, and in turn how they view politics. That could have been a huge challenge. I believe we've been successful in navigating that challenge. And as we get to a point that inflation is at a low and a stable rate, the ECB will then make their decisions.
