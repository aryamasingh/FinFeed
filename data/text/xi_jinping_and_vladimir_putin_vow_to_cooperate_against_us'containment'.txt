 So there's friendship without limits. What have we seen in terms of how far that's progressed with this meeting? Well, I think what we've seen throughout the war in Ukraine is that no limits, friendship has certain limits that Chinese have while providing rhetorical support in places like the United Nations and providing economic support. China's still buying Russian oil, buying Russian commodities, exporting consumer goods and electronics to Russia. At the same time, China has not provided the weapons that Vladimir Putin, I'm sure, would love to see China supply to it. That has not reduced the tensions that its relationship with Russia has brought in terms of Beijing's relationship with Washington. We've seen Secretary Blinken raise on several occasions the issue of dual-use technologies that China supplies to Russia, things that can be used for both military and civilian purposes. And so it is something that we are still trying to figure out, but certainly some limits to that relationship so far. What about the limits when it comes to China's financial system? Because we know Putin wants more access to that for Russia, but there's always that risk, of course, of US sanctions. That's right. The US has made it very clear that any Chinese banks any Chinese companies that provide assistance to Russia's war effort, provide materials that are used to fight in Ukraine will come under American sanctions. If you are a large Chinese financial institution, that is not what you want at this moment to be cut off from the US dollar markets. So that has been taken very seriously here. It is another reason that you see Beijing and Moscow both sort of talking about the need to cooperate to fend off US containment. Beijing sees this as the long arm of American hegemony, if anything else.
