also rolled least two batches ultra long special bonds one issued course week half back course results bond auction friday certainly lot demand ultra long bonds turned page guess conversation yeah key question asking next guest hour richard ku chief economist nomura research institute may remember year ago really warning china entering possibly japan like balance sheet recession richard pleasure program lets start stimulus measures policy pivots weve heard multiple fronts whether monetary fiscal housing market significant enough turn around economy well short answer probably reason think way chinese entering call balance sheet recession balance sheet recession happens people stop minimizing debt instead maximizing profits people leverage bubble asset prices collapse know prices liabilities balance sheet often underwater reduce debt everybody time economy really suffers national economy someone saving money someone else borrowing money usual economy us financial sector take money savers given someone use many borrowers rates raised central bank borrowers rates lower make sure cycle maintained entered japan 30 years ago china may entering situation bring interest rates zero low levels still theyre enough borrowers people repairing balance sheets borrowing money period still hear lot chinese people reluctant buy real estate borrowed money especially dont think prices go could actually come even environment difficult get borrowers come even low interest rates structural reform arguments hear chinese mean reforms welcome think long overdue question would enough fill gap people saving money people borrowing money may give example suppose 1000 income spend nine hundred nine hundred already someone elses income thats problem hundred dollars say go financial sector like us give someone use many borrowers hundred dollars rates raised rates lower theyre thats usual economy moves call balance use session happens 1000 income spend nine hundred nine hundred problem hundred dollars often get stuck financial sector borrowers even low interest rates situation way turn situation improve economy government borrow money private sector right things trying repair balance sheets tell repeat balance sheets everybody right things get wrong result know called fallacy composition english government outside lot conversation come amount chinese government coming forward dont think sufficient really stabilize turn situation around right richard maybe central government starting direction im sure agree agree narrative central government started come issue special purpose response im wondering whether think thats right route mentioned government starts needs start borrowing also number think central government government borrowing given scale chinese economy debt burden theyre trying unwind well well first question pay lot attention central government numbers know put local provincial governments chinese government financial deficit less equivalent budget deficit almost seven percent gdp 2022 budget deficit bubble burst already seven percent gdp always resistance increase justified balance financial recession financial recession started probably 2023 2022 2022 know still bubble japan fell thing japan budget surplus bubble days easy japanese government increase deficit spending surplus chinese government even though central government budget deficit large put whole thing together call general government budget deficit already 7 think theres strong resistance local governments provincial governments probably many economists saying hey debt already large increase thats resistance coming difference japanese chinese situation another difference back 1990 saltine collapsed bubble collapsed one japan including idea entering say poj brought rates zero nothing happens fiscal stimulus never created keynesian pump priming structural reform measures never produced results promised completely lost know case youre putting structural reform unless someone responds immediately borrows 100 mentioned earlier 900 plus 100000 original income likely happen structural reform things typically take long time im happy chinese government coming structural reform issues immediate effect im skeptical youre saying china cant really export way problems richard given trade surplus policy direction seeing xi jinping agenda comes higher end manufacturing evs like facing pushback western nations tariffs potential threat tariffs see industrial policy playing well middle usjapan trade friction 30 years ago walter mondale ambassador japan time realized im japanese television lot economic programs actually carry american passport asked get pitch american argument japan open market forth pushing debate private sector citizen still employee nomura ugly debate bad feelings sides growing rapidly remember experience typical economist wall street firms ended look whats happening china today see pattern key point time japan largest trade surplus country world running huge surplus united states see china exactly position china largest trade surplus country world running huge surplus recently united states pattern developing people saying well youre already running largest trade surplus world expand destabilize global trade furthermore china paying subsidies many companies many industries feeling within trade circles hey china subsidies cant fight tariffs youre supposed raise tariffs within wto membership countries side something youre supposed course think things defend thats think debate moving dont think china moving subsidies various helps industries anytime soon many companies course governmentowned feeling unless something perhaps exchange rate going difficult stop trade getting worse say richard since brought exchange rate correct im wrong main difference japan china exchange rate regime said china let markets fully determine say dollar china exchange rate trading right think goes direction dollar yen bubble burst effectively go 80 well time us upset us government made displeasure japanese opening market many restrictions scared investors japan buying us treasuries japanese investors stop buying us assets look trade japans huge surplus country basically pushed dollar lower yen higher ended know 79 75 yen dollar 1995 basically precluded japan running export economic growth chinese case doesnt work way theres much capital controls begin exchange rate still largely control government government tries keep exchange rate appreciating trying weaken yen sense us push
