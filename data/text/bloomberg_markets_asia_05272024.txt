insight shane oliver head investment strategy chief economist amp capital shane good us lots digest front center pce would crucial week think think probably course us asian time zone come markets closed comes friday nights numbers going looked pretty closely good chance core pce exclude food energy come 02 probably high 02 mean 024 case knocks annual rate 27 also effect dropping us range 03 range last months would certainly good news obviously weve got fair way go yes one months worth lower inflation numbers enough fed wants see run weaker inflation numbers cut interest rates essentially change anything though shane weve already gone six cuts year perhaps one two expecting well think reality could go back earlier year market expecting six think one stage seven expectation would start around march believe course weve gone september july look unlikely sorry june july look unlikely theres lot meetings left time get september think odds unless economy slides recession much weaker inflation numbers end two cuts year probably september maybe another one one get christmas dont think pce numbers change anything except add confidence get cuts start september rather little bit later well thing risk appetite really dented much talk risk sentiment returned today thing see higher longer really impact sentiment might well may think whats happened year yes weve seen wide back interest rate cut expect patients delay timing markets said oh doesnt matter weve got stronger profit numbers therefore somewhat bad news interest rates replaced better news profits thats kept markets going long get combination sort mix going forward high longer interest rates major problem market problem would arise course get much weaker economic data inflation numbers stay somewhat elevated sort leads talk stagflation get would bad news markets think likely scenario get softer inflation numbers markets like course next issue would well economic growth going weak going end year 2025 would start turn story around go goldilocks hot cold risk might recession obviously hasnt much concern last months shane comes bond yields running higher may short term think likely scenario head remainder year going next year mainly going see somewhat slower inflation numbers confirm likelihood fed cut interest rates starting september cuts year little bit next year well probably also see weaker economic growth already starting see signs march quarter gdp numbers us came 16 think get update week might revised 13 something thereabouts think slower growth slower inflation enable bond yields drift lower course uncertainty around us election guess separate issue trump victory could inflationary guess still several months away yet november know outcome shane big debate right neutral rate neutral whats driving well thats academic question bit like neighborhood socalled natural rate unemployment would think us probably 25 one stars star bit like new star natural unemployment rate course stars economists multiple different views suspect probably little bit higher feds 25 memory latest longterm rate projection fedbunds rate probably little bit higher think allow come world somewhat inflationprone five years ago prior pandemic policies deglobalization protectionism low unemployment bigger governments subsidies regulation sorts things make world somewhat inflationprone course artificial intelligence could go opposite direction theres lot forces sort lined suspect neutral rate probably little bit higher 25 really hard work much higher shane given assumptions youve made conversation portfolio looking like right well think probably bit growth bias think still upside share markets slight overweight share markets dont want big overweight big runs markets bear market lows back 2022 october 2022 weve certainly big runup since correction last october going get volatility going constrained ride weve seen going volatile ride think thats evidence weve seen last weeks last month going rougher

would bad investment markets havent really come pass yes seeing issues around taiwan full war thing thats going many many years yes seeing war middle east actually disrupting flow oil global economy yes seeing trade disruptions red sea trade still occurring yes things negative margin theyre enough cause major disruption think thats markets focused fact youve got relatively high levels sentiment low levels bigs tells theres lot big buffer anything goes wrong one tensions flare obviously share markets would vulnerable trying time think going really really hard many many years youre often better waiting event occur occur respond odds youll probably get timing wrong added risk geopolitical tensions would perhaps deter attracted chinese stocks even though weve seen recovery well

treasury department preparing launch series buybacks sunnobang begins taper pace balance sheet runoff bloomberg live executive editor mark cutmore joins us first lets start fed speak theyre likely cautious hawkish yeah think theyre going hawkish week think fundamental issues slowing qt process fact specific buybacks first time 20 years think theyre kind well flagged structural think backdrop week actually yields continue kind nudge higher narrative adjusting fact inflation still sticky financial conditions super loose theres real justification central banks central banks world easing aggressively yet ecb probably get away one theyre precommitted makes sense still dont see fed discussing rate cuts anytime soon conversation shane oliver says selected trend low mean chances could right mean obviously thats narrative last yields ultimately trend lower sure know consensus next move lower fields absolutely idea rate hikes flirted occasionally rapidly dismissed dont think many people thinking way thats consensus view know likelihood consensus right youd say got high consensus im actually saying consensus overestimated probability underestimated risk fact yields arent trending lower assumption long qt well obviously going slow pace thats thats going help thats going ease stress actually think fed managed well far dont know thats know real big dynamic thats real big problem think know fundamental drivers level interest rate policy adequate economy economy still holding well growth still strong markets performing really well financial conditions super loose economy sending message going hey monetary policy appear tight anything look markets look inflation look financial conditions says monetary policy loose would indicate yield higher yeah thats right right hear fed saying policy restrictive question whether restrictive enough given inflation right might hear different narrative think theyre going slowed change rhetoric terms reaction function fed remain dovish theyre trying clear well cut soon get excuse cut thats theyre theyve clear since december fed problem excuse cut right arguable fed policy restrictive maybe might restrictive doesnt seem like theres much sign right true theres long variable lags like using phrase lots recent years therefore restriction policy last couple years might still impact definitely true extent theres real sign actually restrictive moment theres chance fed hike fed data dependent central banks data dependent lot data coming week make sense like play markets data dependence thing bit weird phrase course central banks always data dependent theyve never moved away think got dangerous world giving much forward guidance back corner like nearly precommitting policy started using phrase data dependent recently kind say hey precommitted theyre trying give optionality theres real change fed always wanted data dependent theres two aspects theres data comes theres policy makers reaction function data moment fed extremely dovish reaction function however theyre still going react data data gives excuse cut cut data kind neutral anything know enforcing hikes hike ultimately two inputs data reaction function japan japan think ultimately hike rates priced market know story overnight saying might half percent think course think base case actually think might know several hikes dont think going change things mastery japan think weve realized know country needs normalize policy itll benefit economy long run yen im still bearish yen mean point look ive bearish yen three years time still remain bearish yen think know dont dont dont confuse yen view dollar yen dollar component think yen absolutely one worst currencies world crosses know deeply negative real yields great economy commodity importer rising commodities world boj significantly changes policy may happen later year im saying yet significantly change policy im taking hike two yen remain bearish crosses right mark great stuff
