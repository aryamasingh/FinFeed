 There probably are some voters who want to know what Trump would do in a second term or what Biden might do in a second term. But let's be honest, we're all going to be looking for something that could become a viral moment that could turn this race one way or the other. Everybody knows that age is an issue for both of these candidates. Biden a little bit older than Trump, but both of them pretty old. So it's really going to be kind of a contest to see, you know, in one sense, who's the last man standing. And in another sense, who can have the least embarrassing performance, I guess, is the best way to put it. This election is going to be decided by a really small portion of swing voters in about six swing states. And believe it or not, there are some persuadable voters out there.
